# CLAUDE.md — Nebulyx

This file is auto-loaded by your coding tool (Claude Code, OpenCode, …) at the start of every session. It defines the project context, active standards, and behavioural contract for all AI work on this project.

---

## Session Start Protocol

At the start of every session the AI assistant must:

1. Begin every response with `[CX <Context code>]` (or bare `[CX]` if no code is set below) — it tells the user you have not forgotten the project context
2. On the first response, declare standards as **not yet loaded**
3. Read `coding-standards/index.md` — loads the full standards map — only on the first turn that actually touches a file (edit, create, or a request needing a convention). Conversational, planning, or review-only turns never trigger this read.
4. Once loaded, confirm active standards below and declare them loaded from that point on

If the token is ever missing from a response — or the Context code is missing or wrong — the session has lost context. Stop immediately, discard the response, and start a new session.

## Active Standards

| Standard | Active |
|---|---|
| CSS standard | `coding-standards/css-standards.md` |
| HTML standard | `coding-standards/html-standards.md` |
| Script standard | `coding-standards/js-standards.md` |
| Git standard | `coding-standards/git-standards.md` |
| Versioning standard | `coding-standards/versioning-standards.md` |
| SEO standard | `coding-standards/seo-standards.md` |
| Performance standard | `coding-standards/performance-standards.md` |
| Accessibility standard | `coding-standards/accessibility-standards.md` |
| QA standard | `coding-standards/qa/index.md` |
| Design standard | `coding-standards/design-standards.md`. Leads only for new UI from scratch. If a design doc, Figma file or design system exists: after UI work, offer once "Want a UI/UX audit against the design standards?"; never audit or change the design unasked. |
| AI standard | `coding-standards/ai-standards.md` |

## Project-Specific Context

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Context code | N7X |
| Project name | Nebulyx |
| Framework | React 18 + Vite 5 (no kit framework standard exists for React) |
| CSS framework | Tailwind CSS 3 (no kit framework standard exists for Tailwind) |
| Script standard | JS only |
| CSS token prefix | None (Tailwind theme tokens) |
| Selector signature | None (Tailwind utility classes) |
| Token file | `tailwind.config.js` |
| Global stylesheet | `src/index.css` |
| Entry scripts | `src/main.jsx` |

## AI Behavioural Contract

- Before editing a file, load its standard chain (role table in `coding-standards/index.md`): discipline standard, file-role partial, framework file
- Every response starts with `[CX <Context code>]` (bare `[CX]` if no code is set)
- First response of every session declares standards as not-yet-loaded; standards load lazily on first file-touching turn, not eagerly at session start
- No restating the task, trailing summaries or filler
- Code comments follow the `comment-style` level (default none: only tool-required ones: `as`/suppression justifications, pragmas, license headers)
- Response shape follows the data (RULE AI-18): table for 2+ items with 2+ attributes, one line for one fact, yes/no for yes/no; `/format` overrides
- Where the tool renders links, file references are markdown links, not bare or inline-code paths (RULE AI-17)
- No invented rules — gaps in standards are flagged to the developer
- **Decision preference (every mode):** weigh token efficiency and correct results first, with minimal Agent-tool use (see `agent-usage`, `mode-kernel`).
- Full rules in `coding-standards/ai-standards.md`

## Skill Triggers

Load the skill BEFORE the action (a skill not loaded is a rule not applied). Remove rows for skills not installed.

| Situation | Skill |
|---|---|
| About to commit | `pre-commit` |
| About to say a task is done | `pre-merge-gate` |
| A build, test or runtime failure whose cause is not obvious | `debug-protocol` |
| A task touching 3+ files | `plan-first` |

---

## Parallel-Session Coordination

(Remove this section if the project does not use the parallel-session system.)

Before claiming or resuming any task in the parallel-session system (`handover/` — board, locks, per-role handovers), read `handover/PROTOCOL.md` and follow it. Never touch a file that is part of shared or locked work without going through that protocol first.

---

## Project State

For current project state, completed work, known issues, and next steps read `handover.md` in the project root.
